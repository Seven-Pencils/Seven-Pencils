Seven-Pencils
=============

Seven Pencils is an everything information test repository for the purposes of test purposes. 

The purpose of <a href="http://www.everythinginformation.com/seven-pencils/" title="seven pencils">Seven Pencils</a> is to seee how much if any value is passed on to the external website from Github. 
Although this experiment has been done before I will test it myself to see whether the pencil seven keyword will rank. If it does that hooray. If not then it was a complete disaster and shall never be tested again.
